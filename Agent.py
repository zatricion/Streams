class Agent(object):
    """
    An agent is an automaton: a state-transition machine.

    An agent has lists of input streams, output streams
    and call streams. Streams are described in Stream.py.
    
    During a state transition an agent may read values from
    its input streams, append values to its output streams,
    change its state and carry out operations on other objects.

    When a call stream is modified the agent's next() method
    is called which causes the agent to execute a state transition.
    
    The default is that every input stream is also a call stream,
    i.e., the agent executes a state transition when any of its
    input streams is modified. For performance reasons, we
    may not want the agent to execute state transitions when some
    input streams are modified; in this case, the sets of call
    and input streams will be different.

    Named_Tuple
    ----------------
    InList : a named_tuple with arguments:
        list, start, stop
        An InList defines the list slice:
                   list[start:stop]
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    in_streams : list of streams
    out_streams : list of streams
    call_streams : list of streams
        When a new value is added to a stream in this list
        a state transition is invoked.
        This the usual way (but not the only way) in which
        state transitions occur.
    state: object
        The state of the agent.
    transition: function
        This function is called in next() which
        is the state-transition operation for this agent.
        An agent's state transition is specified by
        its transition function.
    stream_manager : function
        Each stream has management variables, such as whether
        the stream is open or closed. After a state-transition
        the agent executes the stream_manager function
        to modify the management variables of the agent's output
        and call streams.
    name : str, optional
        name of this agent

    Attributes
    ----------
    _in_lists: list of InList
        The j-th element of _in_lists is an InList
        that defines the slice of the j-th input stream
        that may be read by this agent in a state
        transition.
              
    _out_lists: list
        The j-th element of the list is the list of
        values to be appended to the j-th output
        stream after the state transition.

    Methods
    -------
    next(stream_name=None)
        Execute a state transition.
        This method (i) sets up the data structures to execute
        a state transition, (ii) calls transition to get the
        (a) values to be appended to output streams, (b) the next state,
        and (c) updates pointers into input streams identifying what
        parts of the stream may be read in the future and finally
        (iii) updates data structures after the transition.
