class Stream(object):
    """
    A stream is a sequence of values. Agents can:
    (1) Append values to the tail of stream. 
    (2) Read a stream.
    (3) Subscribe to be notified when a
    value is added to a stream.

    The ONLY way in which a stream can be
    modified is that values can be appended to its
    tail. The length of a stream (number of elements
    in its sequence) can stay the same or increase,
    but never decreases. If at some point, the length
    of a stream is k, then from that point onwards, the
    first k elements of the stream remain unchanged.

    A stream is written by only one agent. Any
    number of agents can read a stream, and any
    number of agents can subscribe to a stream.
    An agent can be a reader and a subscriber and
    a writer of the same stream.

    If agent x is a subscriber to a stream s then
    x.next() --- a state transition of x --- is
    invoked whenever s is modified.

    READING A STREAM
    An agent can read a stream only after it registers
    with the stream as a reader. An agents r registers
    with a stream s by executing s.reader(r).
    
    After a reader of a stream s reads the first k
    values s, the reader may determine that from that
    point onwards, it will no longer read the
    first j values of the stream for some j where
    j <= k.
    A reader r of a stream s can inform s at a point
    in the computation that from that point onwards
    r will no longer read the first j values of the
    stream, for some j. Stream s uses this information
    to manage its memory.

    Associated with each stream s is a list s.recent
    which consists of the most recent elements of s.
    s.recent is a tailing subsequence (or suffix) of
    s.
    If the value of s is a sequence s[0], ..., s[n-1],
    at a point in a computation then at that point,
    s.recent is a list s[m], .., s[n-1] for some m.
    
    The length of s.recent is large enough so that at
    each point in a computation, all readers of stream
    s only read elements of s that are in s.recent. 
    Operations on streams are implemented as operations
    on lists. A reader reads a stream s by reading the
    list s.recent.

    Associated with a reader r of stream s is an
    integer s.start[r]. Reader r can only read the slice
    s.recent[s.start[r] : ] of the list recent.
    Reader r informs stream s that it will only
    read values in the list recent with indexes
    greater than or equal to j by calling
         s.set_start(r, j)
    which causes s.start[r] to be set to j.
    
    For readers r1 and r2 of a stream s the values
    s.start[r1] and s.start[r2] may be different.

    WRITING A STREAM
    An agent adds elements to a stream s by calling
    s.append(value) or s.extend(value_list); these
    operations are similar to operations on lists.
    s.append(value) appends the single value to the
    tail of the list and s.extend(value_list) extends
    the stream by the sequence of values in the list
    value_list.

    SUBSCRIBE TO BE CALLED WHEN A STREAM IS MODIFIED
    An agent x subscribes to a stream s by executing
            s.call(x).
    Then, when stream s is modified, s calls x.next(s)
    where next() executes a state-transition.
    An agent x unsubscribe from a stream s by executing
            s.delete_caller(x)

    CLOSING A STREAM
    A stream can be closed or open (i.e., not closed).
    Initially a stream is open. The agent that writes a
    stream s can close s by executing s.close().
    A closed stream cannot be modified.
    
    Associated with a stream s is:
    (1) a list, s.recent. 
    (2) a nonnegative integer s.stop  where:
      (a) the slice s.recent[:s.stop] contains
      the most recent values of stream s, and
      (b) the slice s.recent[s.stop:] is
      padded with padding values (either 0 or 0.0).
    (3) a nonnegative integer s.offset where
          recent[i] = stream[i + offset]
             for 0 <= i < s.stop
    For example, if the stream s consists of range(950),
    i.e., 0, 1, .., 949, and s.offset is 900, then
    s.recent[i] = s[900+i] for i in range(50).

    Note that the number of entries in stream s is:
    s.offset + s.stop

    Parameters
    ----------
    name: str (optional)
          name of the stream. Though the name is optional
          a named stream helps with debugging.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    recent: list
          A list of the most recent values of the stream.
    stop:   index into the list recent.
          s.recent[:s.stop] contains the s.stop most recent
          values of stream s.
          s.recent[s.stop:] contains padded values.
    offset: index into the stream.
          For a stream s:
          s.recent[i] = s[i + offset] for i in range(s.stop)
    start: dict of readers.
             key = reader
             value = start index of the reader
             Reader r can read the slide recent[start[r] : ]
    subscribers_set: set
             the set of subscribers for this stream, agents to be notified when an
             element is added to the stream.
    closed: boolean
             True if and only if the stream is closed.
             A closed stream is not modified.
    _buffer_size: nonnegative integer
            Used to manage the recent list.
    _begin: index into the list recent
            recent[_begin:] mqy be read by some reader.
            recent[:_begin] is not being accessed by any reader;
            therefore recent[:_begin] can be safely deleted.
