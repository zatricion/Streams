"""This module contains examples of the op() function
where:
op(f,x) returns a stream where x is a stream, and f
is a function from a list and state to a list and state.
The state keeps track of the input stream up to the
current point.

Examples of the op() function, in its stateless form
are found in ExamplesOpNoState.py

The form of the call to op is:
op(f, in_stream, state, call_streams=None)
where f is the function from list, state to list, state,
and in_stream is the single input stream, and
call_streams is the list of streams that cause op()
to be invoked. If call_streams is None then the function
is invoked whenever a value is appended to in_stream.
