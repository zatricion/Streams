<h1>
STREAMS AND AGENTS
</h1>

<p> <strong>Introduction to Streams and Agents: </strong> A
<em>stream</em> is a sequence of values.  An object that carries out
computation on a stream is called an <em>agent</em>. An agent can
modify a stream only by appending values to the end of the stream. An
agent appends a value <code>v</code> to a stream <code>s</code> by
calling <code>s.append(v)</code>. Arbitrary numbers of agents can
append values to a stream and read a stream.  </p>

The values in a stream can be of arbitrary types. A stream is similar
to a list. An agent can read the k-th value of a stream for k =
0, ..., stream-length - 1. Most agents access values in a stream in
increasing order of index.



<p> <strong>Pages: </strong> Associated with a stream <code>s</code>
are attributes <code>len</code>, <code>page</code>,
<code>win_end</code> and <code>win_len</code> where:

<ol>
  <li>
   <code>s.len</code> is the number of values that have been appended
   to the stream. So, <code>s.len</code> is the length or size of
   stream <code>s</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>s.win_len</code> is a parameter set by the creator of stream
  <code>s</code>. It is a positive integer and is the length
  of the window into the stream.
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>s.page</code> is a list which is a slice of stream
  <code>s</code>. The contents of this list are described later.
  </li>
  <li>
  <code>s.win_end</code> is an index in <code>s.page</code> and it
  refers to the end of the window into <code>s.page</code>.
  </li>
</ol>

If <code>s.len < s.win_len</code> then:

<br>

<code>s.win_end = s.len</code>, and agents can read the list
<code>s.page[0 : s.win_end]</code>. 

<br>

If <code>s.len >= s.win_len</code> then:

<br>

<code>s.win_end >= s.win_len</code>, and agents can read the list
<code>s.page[s.win_end - s.win_len : s.win_end]</code>.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Subscribers: </strong> An agent that reads a
stream is called a <em>subscriber</em> to that stream. An
agent can subscribe to an arbitrary number of streams. An agent
subscribes for a stream <code>s</code> by
executing
<br>
<code>s.subscribe(self)</code>.
<br>
When a new value is appended to stream <code>s</code>, the
stream executes:
<br>
<code>x.new_value_in_stream(s)</code>,
</br>
for each subscriber <code>x</code> of the stream.

<h2>Simple Examples</h2>
<h3>PrintStreamAgent</h3>
A simple example of an agent is PrintStreamAgent which subscribes to a
single stream and prints the values that are appended to this
stream. This agent does not append values to any stream. So, this
agent has a single "input," i.e., the stream it reads, and has no
output. When this agent is invoked with:
<br>
<code>new_value_in_stream(stream)</code>
</br>
it prints: <code>stream.page[stream.win_end - 1]</code> because
<code>stream.win_end -1 </code> is the index in
<code>stream.page</code> of the last value that was appended to the
stream. 
<h3>MapStreamAgent</h3>
Another simple example of an agent is MapStreamAgent which subscribes to a
single stream, maps the values appended to this stream using a map
function, and appends the result on an output stream. This
agent has a single input and single output stream. When this agent is invoked with:
<br>
<code>new_value_in_stream(stream)</code>
</br>
it applies the map function to : <code>stream.page[stream.win_end - 1]</code>
and appends the result to the output stream.

<h2>Agents that Operate on Moving Windows</h2>
An agent can operate on a moving window of a stream provided that the
length of the agent's moving window does not exceed the stream
attribute win_len_max.

<h3>WinMaxAgent</h3>
<p>

This agent has a single input stream and a single output stream. One
of the parameters of this agent is the size of this agent's window
into its input stream. The agent computes the maximum value in the
agent's moving window when a new value is appended to the input
stream, and appends this maximum value to the agent's output
stream.

</p>

<p>

Suppose the input stream has values 50, 49, 52, 31, 20, 19, 60 appended to
it in that order, i.e., 50 first, then 49, then 52,... Assume that
<code>size</code>, the length of the WinMaxAgent's window is 3. Then
the output stream will have the following values appended to it in
order: None, None, 52, 52, 52, 31, 60...
</p>

<p>The first two values are None because the stream doesn't have
enough (i.e., <code>size</code>) values to carry out a
computation. The agent carries out its first computation on the list
slice [50, 49, 52], and returns 52, which it appends to its output
stream. It carries out its next computation on the list [49, 52, 31],
and returns 52 which it appends to its output stream. The agent then
operates on lists [52, 31, 20], [31, 20, 19], and [20, 19, 60] and
appends 52, 31, and 60 to its output lists.
</p>

<p> Consider the computation that needs to be carried out when the
list changes from [50, 49, 52] to [49, 52, 31]. A new value, 31, is
added to the list and a value, 52, is removed from the list. Since the
value (31) added to the list, and the value (50) removed from the list
do not exceed the previous max (52), the max does not change. For the
same reason, the max doesn't change when the list changes from [49,
52, 31] to [52, 31, 20].
</p>

<p> When the list changes from [52, 31, 20] to [31, 20, 19] the max is
recomputed because the value (19) added to the list is less than the
max of the previous window, and the value (52) removed from the list
is equal to the value of the previous window.
</p>

<p>
This agent also has a parameter <code>start_position</code> which is
the value of <code>input_stream.win_end</code> at which the agent
starts carrying out computations. If this parameter is not specified,
then its default value is <code>size</code>, the length of the agent's
moving window.
</p>

<h2>Structure of Window Agents</h2>
Window agents execute code with three parts (one of which is to return
without doing anything) in response to
<code>new_value_in_stream(self, stream):</code>
<ol>
  <li>
  If <code>stream.win_end < self.start_position</code>:
  return without doing anything because the stream doesn't have enough
  values for a calculation on windows.
  </li>
  <li>
  If <code>stream.win_end == self.start_position</code>:
  Carry out the step at the start position; this is the
  <em>initial</em> computational step.
  </li>
  <li>
  If <code>stream.win_end > self.start_position</code>:
  Carry out a step after the start position; this is a
  <em>continuing</em> computational step.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>WinMinAgent</h3>
See the description of WinMaxAgent.

<h3>WinMeanSigmaAgent</h3>
These agents keep track of the sum of values in the agent's window and
the sum of the square of values in the window.
<ol>
  <li>
  If <code>stream.win_end == self.start_position</code>: Compute the
  sums of values and values squared.
  </li>
  <li>
  If <code>stream.win_end > self.start_position</code>: Update the
  sums by subtracting the value that drops out of the agent's window
  and adding the value that enters the window.
  </li>
</ol>
The mean and sigma (standard deviation) are computed from the sums of
values and values squared.
